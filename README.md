## The application WEATHER.CUBE was created as part of a diploma project on the Professional Web Development course (advanced level).


### The type of stack used in this application consists of frontend technology:

| Number |                  Technology                   |
|-------:|-----------------------------------------------|
|       1| React (React Function Components, React Hooks)|
|       2| React Router                                  |
|       3| Redux Toolkit (RTK Query)                     |
|       4| OpenWeather API                               |
|       5| TypeScript                                    |
|       6| SCSS modules                                  |

The design of WEATHER.CUBE app was also developed by me using Figma.
